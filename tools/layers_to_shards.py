layers_to_shards.py - which shards does a `--layers N` run actually need?

WHY THIS EXISTS
    `--layers N` binds only the first N decoder layers, so it runs against a partial
    shard set. But which shards hold layers 0..N-1 is not something you can guess from
    the filenames: tensors are packed bin-first, so one layer spans several shards and
    one shard holds slices of several layers (layer 0 alone touches shards 1 AND 2,
    while the embedding table and the output head both live in shard 94). Guessing
    "the first K shards" downloads the wrong set and the engine refuses it with
    "missing tensors in this shard set" after the gigabytes have already moved.

    The Hub publishes the exact tensor-to-shard map as model.safetensors.index.json
    (59 MB, fetched by download-model.sh before this runs). This script reads that map
    and prints the minimal shard set for the requested prefix: every shard holding any
    tensor of layers 0..N-1, plus the shards holding the embedding table and the
    output head, which every run needs regardless of depth.

    usage: layers_to_shards.py <model.safetensors.index.json> --layers N

    Prints one shard filename per line, sorted, on stdout. Anything else is an error:
    exit 2, following the engine's own convention that a usage or config problem is
    exit 2, never a silent default.
